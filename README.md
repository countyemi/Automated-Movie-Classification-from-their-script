# Automated-Movie-Classification-from-their-script
This project builds a model to automate the classification of movies into their age rating and genre from their scripts

Classification of movies into different age groups is essential in order to keep children and vulnerable adults safe from harm, and also to enable viewers make informed viewing decisions.
This project automates the classification of movies into their age ratings using Deep learning and ML classifiers as well as classify movies into genres using the Topic Modelling approach
